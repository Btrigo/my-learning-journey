# Daily Study Log — 2026-01-21

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Had extensive career planning session with Claude about cloud security path
- Designed complete professional portfolio website (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Created comprehensive AWS deployment strategy for portfolio
- Restructured my learning journey GitHub repository plan
- Analyzed current file structure and created reorganization roadmap
- Made critical decision: focus on AWS cloud security instead of help desk jobs

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- **I will succeed no matter what.** This is non-negotiable.
- **Strategic patience wins:** Taking a hiatus from entry-level help desk applications to build deep AWS cloud security expertise (Jan-Aug 2026)
- **Financial stability first:** Current supervisory position at Dick's + plumbing side work + benefits (health, 401k, paid leave) gives me the foundation to build properly
- **Baby timeline matters:** Due date August 30th - having stable income with 1 month paid paternity leave is GOLD
- **Quality over speed:** Better to land a $70K-$85K Cloud Security Engineer role in Nov 2026 than rush into $40K help desk now
- **Portfolio as project:** My AWS-hosted portfolio deployment counts as Project #1 - documenting deployment = learning + showcase
- **Repository structure = professional presentation:** Organized GitHub shows methodology and seriousness to employers
- **Projects should be individual builds, not categories:** Each numbered project folder = one complete thing I built
- **TryHackMe is practice, not standalone projects:** Deserves its own top-level folder separate from projects
- The difference between "looking for any IT job" vs "deliberately building toward cloud security engineer" changes everything

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- Portfolio development with HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript
- Modern CSS variables and responsive design patterns
- AWS S3 static website hosting concepts
- CloudFront CDN distribution planning
- Route 53 DNS management strategy
- GitHub repository organization and structure
- Markdown documentation best practices
- File structure planning and migration strategy

## 📊 Major Decisions Made
- **Career path:** Cloud Security Engineer (not help desk)
- **Timeline:** Build expertise Jan-Aug 2026, start applying Nov 2026
- **Certifications:** AWS Solutions Architect Associate (April 2026) → AWS Security Specialty (August 2026)
- **Current job:** Keep Dick's supervisory role for stability + benefits during baby arrival
- **Portfolio strategy:** Deploy to AWS as first hands-on project, document everything
- **Learning approach:** 80% AWS/cloud security, 20% selective applications only if role is exceptional

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- Should I get AWS Solutions Architect Associate first or jump straight to Security Specialty?
- How to balance daily study time with full-time work + pregnant wife + side plumbing work?
- Best way to document daily progress without it becoming overwhelming?
- How to structure first real AWS project (VPC security design) after portfolio deployment?
- What's the difference between my `daily-notes/` and `daily-logs/` folders? Should I merge them?

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- **begin updating github repo structure**
- read auto-suggestion/purpose statement aloud daily
- listen to chapter four of think and grow rich every night until your belief in yourself is unwavering. 
- syncing github project... claude .ai
- Think and grow rich daily affirmation chat via claude.ai - inspect, read, expand 
- figure out which cloud cert should be the first one to go for.

## 💭 Reflection
Today was a turning point. I made the strategic decision to BUILD PROPERLY. 

Better plan: Keep stable income, use the next 10 months to build DEEP cloud security expertise, then land a $70-85K Cloud Security Engineer role when I'm actually ready. The portfolio website and learning journey repository are the foundation of this strategy.

I have clarity now. I have a plan. I have the discipline. Most importantly, I have the time to do this right.

**This is the way.**

## 🔥 Momentum Check
- **Mindset:** 🔥🔥🔥 Crystal clear on direction
- **Energy:** 🔋🔋 Good - excited about the plan
- **Focus:** 🎯🎯🎯 Locked in - no more scattered applications
- **Confidence:** 📈 Building - I know what I need to do
