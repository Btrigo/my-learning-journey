# Daily Study Log — 2024-12-18

## 📚 What I Worked On
- **FIRST OFFICIAL COMMIT TO GITHUB REPO!!** 
- prepared for desktop OS change:
    - Created USB drive with Linux ISO (Windows → Linux conversion)
    - Backed up important data 
- Lab exercises on Linux package management, services, and processes
- Learned Git basics: initialization, staging, committing, and pushing to remote repository
- Set up GitHub repository for tracking my Linux learning journey

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways

- **Package Management**: apt vs dpkg - apt handles dependencies automatically, dpkg doesn't. Always run `sudo apt update` before installing.
- **Services**: Critical distinction - start/stop = immediate action, enable/disable = boot behavior. Must do BOTH to ensure service survives reboot.
- **Process Hierarchy**: Every process except init (PID 1) has a parent. Killing parent kills all children.
- **Nice Values**: -20 to +19 range. LOWER number = HIGHER priority (counterintuitive!)
- **Background Processes**: After Ctrl+Z, MUST run `bg` or process stays frozen. Use `&` to start directly in background.
- **Git Workflow**: `git init` → `git add .` → `git commit -m "message"` → `git push origin main`
- **GitHub**: Remote repository serves as backup and version control for my learning materials

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced

**Package Management:**
```bash
apt search firefox
sudo apt update
sudo apt install firefox
apt list -a package_name
```

**Service Management:**
```bash
systemctl status apache2
sudo systemctl start apache2        # Start now
sudo systemctl enable apache2       # Auto-start on boot
sudo systemctl stop apache2
sudo systemctl disable apache2
```

**Process Management:**
```bash
ps -eaf                            # View all processes
ps -eaf | grep firefox             # Find specific process
kill -9 <PID>                      # Force kill process
killall firefox                    # Kill all by name
htop                               # Interactive process viewer
sudo renice -n 5 -p <PID>         # Lower priority of a process 
```

**Background/Foreground:**
```bash
firefox &                          # Run in background
Ctrl+Z → bg                        # Suspend then background
fg                                 # Return to foreground
jobs                               # List background jobs
```

**Git Commands:**
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin <url>
git push -u origin main
git status
```

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- What happens to zombie processes? How do they get cleaned up?
- SIGTERM vs SIGKILL?
- best practices for managing third-party repositories - security concerns?
- how does systemd compare to older init systems (SysVinit)?
- how to handle merge conflicts in Git
- advanced linux administration stuffs 

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- review and practice Linux fundamentals 
- Review process troubleshooting scenarios
- Continue daily commits to GitHub repo
