# Daily Study Log — 2025-12-17

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Linux partitions and mounting in VirtualBox VM
- Got into how the stackroute/infoseclearning lab setup works (basically remote desktop through browser via websockets)
- fdisk practice - creating partition tables and partitions on /dev/sdb
- Formatting partitions and mounting them persistently (/etc/fstab)

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- Sectors are the actual storage units on disk (usually 512 bytes). Partitions are just labeled ranges of those sectors - not physically separate things
- DOS/MBR partition tables max out at 4 primary partitions (or 3 primary + 1 extended with logical partitions inside). 
- GPT is way better - 128 partitions, supports huge disks (9.7 ZB lol), has backup partition table
- fdisk doesn't write changes until you hit 'w' which is clutch for not screwing things up
- Partitions start at sector 2048 (= 1 MiB) for alignment reasons
- mount command is temporary, fstab is for persistent mounts across reboots
- /media is for automounted stuff (USB drives), /mnt is for manual mounts

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced

```bash
lsblk                    # see all block devices
lsblk -f                 # shows filesystem types too
df -hT                   # mounted filesystems with sizes

sudo fdisk /dev/sdb      # partition management
# inside fdisk: m=help, p=print, g=GPT table, n=new partition, w=write

sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1 # format partition
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /home/student/one
sudo umount /dev/sdb1

sudo nano /etc/fstab     # edit persistent mounts
sudo mount -a            # mount all fstab entries (for testing)
```

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- Need to understand loop devices better - still fuzzy on that
- How to change ownerships/groups all at once 
- What happens if fstab is wrong and system won't boot? Recovery mode?
- Should probably practice with UUIDs instead of device names for fstab

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- managing and troubleshooting linux services and processes 
- Maybe try resizing partitions with parted/gparted
- Practice user/group management stuff
- Look into swap partitions 
- Review filesystem check (fsck) more - when to use it, what the options mean
