# Daily Study Log — 2026-01-06

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Installed and configured Thunderbird as a desktop email client (Mail User Agent) on Ubuntu
- Added and validated three Gmail-hosted email accounts within a single email client
- Learned and applied digital email signing using OpenPGP
- Reviewed and clarified concepts around TLS, OpenPGP, S/MIME, PKI, and enterprise email trust models

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- Digital signatures provide message integrity and sender authenticity, not confidentiality
- OpenPGP is an appropriate standard for personal or home-lab environments without enterprise PKI
- Enterprise environments typically rely on S/MIME backed by internal PKI and Certificate Authorities (often tied to Active Directory)
- Thunderbird separates cryptographic key management from message composition behavior
- OpenPGP keys are managed within the email client’s protected profile and should be backed up securely

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- Thunderbird (email client / MUA)
- OpenPGP key generation and management (via Thunderbird UI)
- Email account configuration using IMAP/SMTP with TLS

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- How certificate auto-enrollment works in Active Directory Certificate Services
- Best practices for OpenPGP key rotation and revocation
- How S/MIME is deployed and managed at scale in Exchange / Microsoft 365 environments

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Verify digitally signed emails from each configured account
- Observe how signed emails appear to Gmail and Outlook recipients
- Begin planning a home lab to practice enterprise PKI concepts (AD CS, certificates)
- Maintain a clear separation between public-facing study logs and private operational notes
