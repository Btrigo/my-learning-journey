# Daily Study Log — YYYY-MM-DD

## 📚 What I Worked On
- network concepts and network troubleshooting
- OSI-layer protocol roles
- 

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways


- markdown language notes 
   - 2-4 indentations "nests" an item and thus created a "nested item"
- FTP - passive mode = client initiates connection
      - avtive mode = server initiates connection 
- border gateway protocol - BGP
- open shortest path first - ospf 
- MPLS = Multiprotocol Label Switching
    Used by ISPs and large enterprises to move traffic efficiently using labels instead of IP lookups
- LDP = Label Distribution Protocol
    the protocol routers use to exchange MPLS labels with each other 
- SD-WAN is used to intelligently route and secure traffic across multiple network links (internet, MPLS, LTE/5G) based on performance, policy, and application needs, instead of relying on static routing.
- SD-WAN abstracts underlying WAN complexity (MPLS, broadband, LTE) by using centralized controllers and policy-based routing instead of manual protocol configuration


## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- show mac address table
- netstat -t
- netstat -u
- arp 
- show ip bgp neighbor 
- show sdwan status 


- ipconfig /flushdns
- curl
- wget

- ipconfig             # Show IP config for all adapters
- ipconfig /all        # Detailed IP info (DHCP, DNS, MAC)
- ipconfig /release    # Release current DHCP lease
- ipconfig /renew      # Request new DHCP lease
- ipconfig /flushdns   # Clear local DNS cache

- ping <host/IP>       # Test reachability and basic latency
- tracert <host>       # Trace route to destination, hop by hop
- pathping <host>      # Ping + tracert combined with per-hop stats

- nslookup <host>      # Query DNS for record info
- nslookup <host> <dns># Query a specific DNS server

- getmac               # Show MAC address(es) of local NICs
- arp -a               # Show ARP cache (IP ↔ MAC mappings)
- route print          # Show routing table

- netstat -an          # Show active connections + listening ports
- netstat -b           # Show which exe owns each connection (admin)
- netstat -t           # show tcp connections
- netstat -u           # show UDP connections 

- hostname             # Show local computer name

- net use              # List or map network drives
- net use Z: \\srv\sh  # Map drive Z: to a network share
- net view             # List visible computers
- net view \\server    # List shares on a specific server
- net share            # Show local shared folders

- netsh interface ipv4 show config   # Show IPv4 config via netsh
- netsh wlan show profiles           # Show saved Wi-Fi profiles


- show mpls ldp neighbor (router CLI command)   # which routers am I exchanging MPLS labels with??


## Advanced / Not Core Desktop Support (Awareness Only)

- SD-WAN internals
- MPLS label exchange
- Service provider routing
