# Daily Study Log — 2025-12-22

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Migrated desktop PC from Windows 10 to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (bare metal)
- Created bootable Ubuntu USB with Balena Etcher
- Backed up all files to USB drive (exFAT format)
- Performed comprehensive security hardening on fresh Ubuntu installation
- Created two public-facing cheat sheets for GitHub portfolio

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- **ALWAYS INSPECT AND SANITIZE YOUR WORK!!!**
- Ubuntu installation process and encryption options
- Defense-in-depth security strategy (firewall, SSH hardening, fail2ban, automatic updates)
- Port number reservations: Well-Known (0-1023), Registered (1024-49151), Dynamic (49152-65535)
- Port 2222 is industry-standard SSH alternative 
- Root account should stay locked; use sudo for admin tasks
- LibreOffice handles .docx/.xlsx but Microsoft 365 web apps + Windows VM recommended for heavy Office use

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y
sudo ufw enable / sudo ufw allow [PORT]/tcp
sudo passwd -l root
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo systemctl restart ssh / sudo sshd -t
sudo apt install fail2ban
sudo fail2ban-client status
git config --global user.name/email
sudo ss -tulpn | grep [PORT]
ip addr
groups / sudo usermod -aG sudo [user]
```

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- SSH key-based authentication setup (disable password auth)
- KVM/QEMU installation for lab VMs
- Creating sanitized vs private documentation (verify approach)
- OneDrive sync client configuration on Linux
- Advanced firewall rules for lab network isolation

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Install KVM/virt-manager for virtualization lab
- Set up first VMs (Ubuntu Server, Windows Server for AD practice)
- Configure OneDrive sync for cloud backup
- Test LibreOffice compatibility with existing Office files
- Continue TryHackMe networking modules
- Push sanitized cheat sheets to GitHub portfolio repo
