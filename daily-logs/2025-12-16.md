# Daily Study Log — 2025-12-16

## 📚 What I Worked On
- lab practice - creating and managing users and groups in linux 
- file and directory permissions
- group ownership and permissions 

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- each file and folder have a user and group owner - user, group, others - rwxrwxrwx
- always use userdel -r to remove home directories 
- adduser is more sophistiated than useradd 

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- chmod 
- adduser 
- userdel
- useradd -m 
- chsh 
- sudo chown :teacher homework // changes group permissions only
- sudo chown teacher homework // changes owner permissions only
- sudo chown owner:group file // changes owner and group permissions simultaneously
- usermod -a -G (-a = append -G = supplementary groups) - adds a user to a supplementary group without removing them from any other groups 
- useradd, userdel, usermod, passwd, chsh
- groupadd, groupdel, gpasswd, groups
- chmod, chown, chgrp
- id, whoami, getent passwd, getent group
- For loops for bulk user/group operations


## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- advanced bulk operations with xargs
- filesystem mounting and /etc/fstab configuration
- access control lists for multiple group permissions on a single file 

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- managing the linux file system
- persistent mounting with /etc/fstab
- study the file system
