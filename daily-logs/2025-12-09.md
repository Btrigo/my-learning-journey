# Daily Study Log — YYYY-MM-DD

## 📚 What I Worked On
- cs50 lecture 2 - arrays 

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- ./ = what must be is the equivalent of double clicking on an icon on your desktop basically
- arrays
- compilers (make)
- libraries
- loops
- printf
- nul characters
- compiling
- bools - 1 byte
- int - 4 bytes 
- long - 8 bytes 
- float - 4 bytes 
- double - 8 bytes 
- char - 1 byte 
- string - ? bytes - can be equivalent to an array of characters - a string will use an extra byte and install a "0" as a placeholder to indicate where the string ends 

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- c language - in C, characters are single quotes (') and strings are double quotes (")
- float
- int
- make
## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- how do i automate various processes in python? 
- python syntax
- should i pursue the CCNA?
- does ./ only apply for c?
- are there other compilers? why make?
- lets get better with md langauge 

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- learn and grow 
- programming and computer science basics
