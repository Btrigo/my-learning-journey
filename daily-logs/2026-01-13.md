# Daily Study Log — 2026-01-13

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Audited my Ubuntu Linux workstation to understand what actions were performed since initial OS deployment
- Investigated package installation history using APT and dpkg logs to determine what software had been installed and when
- Installed a core Linux administration, troubleshooting, logging, and security toolset (networking tools, monitoring utilities, security auditing tools)
- Verified host security posture, ensuring no unintended services or network exposure were introduced
- Validated CPU virtualization support and confirmed KVM kernel modules were loaded and active
- Learned the architectural difference between KVM (kernel-level virtualization) and libvirt (user-space VM management)
- Continued job search efforts and applied to approximately 10 entry-level IT / technical roles

---

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- `dpkg` is the low-level package manager responsible for installing `.deb` packages and maintaining the authoritative database of installed software
- `apt` acts as a higher-level dependency resolver and planner, while `dpkg` performs the actual installation and logging
- `dpkg -l` output is alphabetical and cannot be used to determine install order or recency
- Accurate install timelines must be reconstructed using `/var/log/dpkg.log*` and `/var/log/apt/history.log*`
- Log rotation explains why package history appears to “stop” at a certain date; older logs are compressed (`.gz`) and must be accessed with `zless` or `zgrep`
- Installing security tools (auditd, rkhunter, AppArmor utilities) may prompt for local mail notification preferences without exposing SMTP or internet-facing services
- KVM being loaded in the kernel confirms hardware virtualization is active, but libvirt is required to manage virtual machines in a practical and persistent way
- Absence of `kvm` and `libvirt` user groups indicates libvirt is not yet installed, not a system issue
- Maintaining a default-deny inbound firewall posture (UFW) significantly reduces risk even when services are installed

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
```bash
# Package management & auditing
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y <packages>
dpkg -l
dpkg -l | grep <package>
sudo less /var/log/dpkg.log
sudo zless /var/log/dpkg.log.1.gz
sudo less /var/log/apt/history.log
sudo zgrep install /var/log/dpkg.log*

# Security & exposure verification
sudo ufw status verbose
sudo ss -tulnp
sudo ss -tulnp | grep LISTEN

# Virtualization validation
egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
lsmod | grep kvm
systemctl status libvirtd

# System inspection
groups
```

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- When and how to install **libvirt** and **virt-manager** safely to begin building a VM-based lab
- Best practices for structuring local virtualization networks (NAT vs isolated vs bridged) for AD, DNS, and DHCP labs
- How to clearly distinguish **manually installed packages** from **automatically installed dependencies**
- How and when system services are enabled automatically during package installation (systemd integration)

---

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Decide whether to proceed with installing **libvirt** and **virt-manager** for VM lifecycle management
- Begin designing a realistic virtualization lab (Windows Server AD + Windows client VM)
- Continue job applications and follow up on roles already submitted
- Maintain documentation of system changes to build a repeatable Ubuntu workstation baseline
