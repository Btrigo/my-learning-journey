# Daily Study Log — 2026-01-14

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Planning, designing, and implementing network in GNS3
- Studied logical and physical networking fundamentals with a focus on managed Layer 2 switches
- Reviewed the role of switches vs routers in TCP/IP-based networks
- Explored managed Layer 2 switch capabilities including MAC address tables and VLAN configuration
- Analyzed access-tier network design and device segmentation concepts

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- Layer 2 switches forward traffic based on MAC addresses, not IP addresses
- Switches dynamically learn and maintain MAC address tables as devices connect, disconnect, or move ports
- VLANs provide logical network segmentation on the same physical switch, preventing communication by default
- Network segmentation at the access tier improves security, reduces broadcast domains, and limits lateral movement
- These concepts directly translate to cloud networking (e.g., VLANs → subnets, access tier → VPC design)

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- Network topology analysis
- VLAN design and segmentation concepts
- MAC address learning and forwarding behavior
- Logical network design principles

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- How inter-VLAN communication is enabled using Layer 3 devices
- How access control is enforced when moving from Layer 2 to Layer 3
- How these concepts are implemented virtually in cloud networking platforms

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Build a local lab with 2–3 virtual machines
- Practice core services: DHCP, DNS, user management, and service control
- OR Build your portfolio in wordpress
