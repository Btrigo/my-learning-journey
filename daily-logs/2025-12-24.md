# Daily Study Log — 2025-12-24

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Continued transitioning to Linux (Ubuntu) as my daily driver  
- Learned how Linux handles software installation using `apt` vs `snap`  
- Installed and verified core desktop tools (LibreOffice, VS Code)  
- Started understanding Linux system layout and package management  
- Set up tooling to improve command-line productivity (`tldr`)

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- Linux does not use a single “Program Files” directory; software is split across `/usr/bin`, `/etc`, `/usr/lib`, `/usr/share`, etc. based on purpose  
- `$PATH` is an ordered list of directories Linux searches to find executables when a command is run  
- LibreOffice is considered a *binary* because the executable is compiled machine code (ELF), even though it loads many supporting files  
- Snap packages are containerized and sandboxed, while APT installs software natively into the system  
- Installing development tools (like VS Code) via APT is preferred for performance, predictability, and professional workflows

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
```bash
which libreoffice
libreoffice --version
snap list
sudo snap remove libreoffice
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libreoffice
sudo apt install tldr
tldr ls
apt list --installed
dpkg -l | grep libreoffice
dpkg -L tldr
which code
code --version
echo $PATH
file /usr/bin/libreoffice
````

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review

* How `$PATH` is constructed across login shells (`.bashrc`, `.profile`, `/etc/environment`)
* When and why to manually add directories to `$PATH`
* Best practices for managing Snap vs APT long term on a daily driver system

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
