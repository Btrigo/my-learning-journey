# Daily Study Log — 2026-01-18

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Completed a full refresh of the **Windows PowerShell room** on TryHackMe  
- Practiced PowerShell fundamentals including cmdlets, pipelines, object properties, and filtering  
- Performed service enumeration and analysis using `Get-Service` and `Where-Object`  
- Investigated network connections using `Get-NetTCPConnection` and identified owning processes  
- Practiced file hashing concepts and verified file integrity using PowerShell  
- Learned and applied remote command execution using `Invoke-Command`  
- Independently derived correct PowerShell syntax by reading built-in documentation (`Get-Help -examples`)  

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- PowerShell is object-oriented, allowing direct filtering and comparison of properties rather than parsing text  
- The `OwningProcess` property from `Get-NetTCPConnection` links network activity to specific processes, which is critical for incident response  
- Service tampering can be detected by comparing `DisplayName` and `Name` properties during service enumeration  
- File hashes act as cryptographic fingerprints and are essential for integrity verification, malware identification, and incident scoping  
- `Get-Help` (especially `-examples`) is a powerful, offline learning tool and can be used to solve problems without external references  
- `Invoke-Command` enables efficient local and remote execution of commands and scripts, forming the foundation for automation and large-scale administration  

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- `Get-Service`
- `Where-Object`
- `Get-NetTCPConnection`
- `Get-FileHash`
- `Get-Help`
- `Invoke-Command`
- `Set-Location`
- `Get-ChildItem`
- TryHackMe Windows PowerShell lab environment  

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- Best practices for structuring reusable PowerShell scripts (`.ps1`) for blue team use  
- Deeper exploration of persistent PowerShell sessions (`New-PSSession`) vs one-off remote commands  
- How PowerShell scripting is integrated into real-world SOC and IR workflows at scale  

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Continue to adjust and optimize the Linux workstation to better fit daily workflow and labbing needs  
- Begin writing small, security-focused PowerShell scripts using variables, conditionals, and loops  
- Further reinforce Linux ↔ Windows command and workflow comparisons
