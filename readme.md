# Brando's Learning Journey
**Cloud Security Engineer in Training | Infrastructure & Security Professional**

> *"Life happens for us, not to us. Every challenge is a chance to learn, adapt, and improve."*

This repository is my public roadmap—a transparent documentation of my path from data center operations to cloud engineering. It's where I centralize my notes, hands-on labs, daily progress, and projects as I build the expertise required to implement and secure cloud infrastructure at scale.

**Why public?** Accountability. Transparency. Proof of consistent effort.
