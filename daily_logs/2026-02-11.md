# Daily Study Log — 2026-02-11

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Reviewed AWS Config and Compliance-as-Code concepts
- Studied AWS Control Tower and multi-account architecture
- Reviewed AWS Organizations, Organizational Units (OUs), and Service Control Policies (SCPs)
- Covered container services: ECS, Fargate, EKS, Lambda
- Studied container tooling: Docker, Kubernetes, Podman, Buildah, Skopeo
- Compared Monolithic vs Microservices architectures
- Reviewed VMs vs Containers
- Studied Application Integration Services: SNS, SQS, EventBridge, Kinesis, Step Functions, API Gateway, MSK, Amazon MQ, AppSync
- Reinforced identity concepts including SAML 2.0 (Enterprise SSO) and API Gateway fundamentals

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- SAML 2.0 is primarily used for Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Amazon API Gateway accepts and processes HTTP/HTTPS requests and routes them to backend services
- AWS Config is a compliance-as-code framework that tracks and evaluates resource configuration changes per region
- AWS Control Tower helps enterprises quickly set up secure multi-account environments with guardrails
- AWS Organizations centralizes billing, governance, and account management using OUs and SCPs
- Containers share a host OS and are lighter weight than virtual machines
- Kubernetes (K8s) orchestrates container deployment, scaling, and management using pods
- Microservices architectures isolate functionality and improve scalability compared to monolithic designs
- SNS (pub/sub) vs SQS (queue) messaging patterns serve different architectural purposes
- Event-driven architectures are foundational in modern cloud-native systems

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- Reviewed Dockerfile structure
- Observed container deployment workflows
- Navigated AWS service documentation and architectural diagrams

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- When to choose ECS vs EKS vs Fargate in real-world production scenarios
- Deeper understanding of Service Control Policies vs IAM policies
- Real-world enterprise use cases for MSK vs Kinesis

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Review multi-account strategy and governance models
- Revisit container orchestration decision trees (ECS vs EKS)
- Continue CLF-C02 course progression
