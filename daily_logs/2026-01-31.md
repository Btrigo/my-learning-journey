# Daily Study Log — 2026-01-31

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Continued **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)** course via **freeCodeCamp**
- Reviewed **AWS global infrastructure concepts**, including regions, Availability Zones, and edge considerations
- Learned about **AWS Outposts** and how AWS integrates cloud services into on-prem environments
- Followed along with **architecture diagrams** explaining real-world AWS deployments (Auto Scaling, ALB, AMIs, CI/CD-style flows)

---

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- **Rack fundamentals (data center basics):**
  - 1 rack unit (1U) = **1.75 inches**
  - Standard full-size rack = **48U (~7 feet tall)**
- **AWS Outposts hardware options:**
  - Available in **42U racks**, **1U**, and **2U** server form factors
  - Designed to bring AWS-managed infrastructure into on-prem or regulated environments
- **Scaling principles:**
  - It’s almost always better to **scale out (horizontal scaling)** rather than scale up
  - Horizontal scaling = adding more servers instead of making one server bigger
  - **Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)** are the AWS mechanism that enables this
- **High-level architecture insight:**
  - Modern AWS architectures rely heavily on:
    - AMIs for consistency
    - Launch Templates for standardization
    - Auto Scaling Groups for resilience
    - Load Balancers for traffic distribution
  - Visual diagrams made these relationships much clearer than reading definitions alone

---

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- Conceptual use of:
  - **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)**
  - **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
  - **Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)**
  - **Launch Templates**
- Architecture diagram tools exposure:
  - AWS Architecture Icons
  - Lucidchart-style diagramming for AWS systems

---

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- Deeper understanding of:
  - How **AMI build pipelines** work end-to-end
  - How **Auto Scaling Groups refresh instances** after AMI updates
- Revisit:
  - Architecture walkthrough section of the video (~**3h 06m**) to reinforce understanding

---

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Continue CLF-C02 course review at a manageable pace
- Rewatch and pause on the **architecture diagram section (~3h 06m)** for deeper comprehension
