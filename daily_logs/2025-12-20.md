# Daily Study Log — 2024-12-20

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Networking fundamentals review via TryHackMe (3 rooms completed)
  - What is Networking
  - Intro to LAN  
  - OSI Model
- Network troubleshooting concepts and methodologies
- Studied IP addressing (IPv4/IPv6), MAC addresses, and how they work together
- Learned ARP process, DHCP DORA sequence, and ICMP (ping)
- Network topologies (star, bus, ring) and when to use each
- Went deep into OSI model - all 7 layers, protocols per layer, troubleshooting approach
- Linux CLI practice from previous week - users and groups, permissions, file and directory management, troubleshooting services and processes

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- **MAC addresses are tied to the NIC** - if you remove the NIC, the MAC address goes with it. Makes sense now why they're called "physical addresses"
- **ARP is the bridge between Layer 2 and Layer 3** - maps IP addresses (logical) to MAC addresses (physical) so switches can actually deliver frames
- **DHCP uses 4-step process (DORA)**: Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge. Different from TCP's SYN-ACK handshake - they serve different purposes
- **OSI model is a troubleshooting framework** - not just theory. Can work bottom-up (physical to application) or top-down depending on the problem
- **Subnetting is about efficiency and security** - isolating networks (like employee vs guest WiFi) prevents security issues and reduces broadcast traffic
- Private IPs (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x) are for internal networks, public IPs for Internet access. Multiple devices share one public IP through NAT
- **Layer 3 devices (routers) strip and replace MAC addresses at each hop** but IP addresses stay the same end-to-end - this clicked for me
- IPv6 has 340 trillion trillion trillion addresses (2^128) vs IPv4's 4.3 billion - finally understand why we needed it
- Switches learn MAC addresses dynamically and only forward frames to the correct port (vs hubs flooding everything)

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- `ping` - testing connectivity, understanding ICMP echo request/reply
- `traceroute` / `tracert` - seeing path packets take through network
- `arp -a` - viewing ARP cache (IP to MAC mappings)
- `nslookup` / `dig` - DNS queries
- `netstat -an` - viewing active connections and listening ports
- `telnet [IP] [port]` - testing if specific ports are open
- `ipconfig` / `ip addr show` - checking IP configuration
- `route print` / `ip route show` - viewing routing tables
- `show mac address-table` (Cisco) - viewing switch MAC table
- `show ip route` (Cisco) - viewing router routing table
- `show interface` (Cisco) - checking interface status and errors

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- How exactly does VLSM work in real network design? I get the concept but want to practice the calculations more
- When would you actually use a /30 subnet in production besides point-to-point links?
- How do you detect ARP spoofing attacks in a real NOC environment? What tools do they use?
- Need to understand routing protocols better (OSPF vs EIGRP vs BGP) - when to use which one
- How does NAT impact certain applications? I've heard it can break some protocols
- What's the difference between stateful and stateless firewalls and how does that relate to the OSI model?
- Should probably review the difference between TCP window scaling and flow control more

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Start work in GNS3 - build a star topology network and get comfortable with the interface
- Continue labbing with TryHackMe (Packets & Frames and Extending Your Network rooms)
- Review my cabling and server rack guide - create a notes section for it
- Work on a network troubleshooting guide/checklist (currently created but needs to be added to directory and refined)
- Maybe try to break/fix something in GNS3 to practice troubleshooting with the OSI model approach
