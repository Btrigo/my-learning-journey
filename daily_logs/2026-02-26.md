# Daily Study Log — 2026-02-26

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Completed **Modules 1–3** of AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials
- Deep dive into:
  - EC2 and compute fundamentals
  - Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing
  - Lambda and serverless architecture
  - Containers (ECS, EKS, ECR)
  - Fargate vs EC2 launch types
  - Elastic Beanstalk, Batch, Lightsail, and Outposts
- Built and refined comprehensive notes for Modules 1–3
- Practiced architectural decision-making (service selection scenarios)

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- AWS compute exists on an abstraction spectrum:
  EC2 → ECS (EC2) → ECS + Fargate → Lambda
- Higher abstraction = less operational responsibility.
- Lambda is ideal for short-lived, event-driven workloads (15-minute max runtime).
- ECS orchestrates containers; Fargate removes the need to manage servers.
- EKS is managed Kubernetes — used when Kubernetes flexibility is required.
- Elastic Beanstalk simplifies web application deployment by provisioning infrastructure automatically.
- AWS Batch is purpose-built for large-scale parallel compute jobs.
- Lightsail is a simplified VPS-style solution.
- Outposts extends AWS infrastructure on-prem for hybrid use cases.
- Shared Responsibility Model is foundational and must be second nature.

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- AWS Skill Builder (Cloud Practitioner Essentials)
- Architecture scenario analysis
- Markdown documentation structuring
- Service comparison decision frameworks

---

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- ECS vs EKS deeper real-world trade-offs
- Fargate vs EC2 cost efficiency at scale
- Real production architecture examples using these services

---

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Begin **Module 4 – AWS Global Infrastructure**
- Study fault tolerance & high availability patterns
- Quick reinforcement review of Modules 1–3
