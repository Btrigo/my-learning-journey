# Daily Study Log — 2026-02-19

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Completed the full **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)** course video.
- Finished final comparison slides and service distinction reviews.
- Consolidated understanding of:
  - KMS vs CloudHSM
  - AWS Managed Keys vs Customer Managed Keys
  - SNS vs SQS
  - SNS vs SES vs Pinpoint vs WorkMail
  - Inspector vs Trusted Advisor
  - Artifact vs Inspector
  - Config vs AppConfig
  - Direct Connect vs Amazon Connect vs MediaConnect
  - Elastic Transcoder vs MediaConvert
  - ELB family (ALB, NLB, GWLB, CLB)

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- Most exam questions test **service differentiation**, not deep configuration.
- Layer awareness matters:
  - ALB = Layer 7 (HTTP/S routing + WAF support)
  - NLB = Layer 4 (TCP/UDP, ultra-low latency)
- Trusted Advisor provides multi-category best-practice recommendations (not just security).
- Inspector audits EC2 workloads; Artifact provides AWS compliance reports.
- KMS integrates broadly across AWS services, especially for encryption at rest.
- Many AWS services have similar names but serve very different architectural layers.

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- AWS Console:
  - Viewed KMS keys and key types
  - Reviewed EC2 launch flow with EBS encryption options
- Conceptual architecture comparison (no CLI usage today)

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- Trusted Advisor categories and real-world examples
- When to use customer-managed KMS keys in enterprise environments
- Architecture patterns combining ALB + NLB
- Revisit AWS global infrastructure wording (Regions, AZs, Edge locations)

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Begin full-length practice exams (e.g. ExamPro / TutorialsDojo)
- Identify weak domains based on first exam results
- Create a concise “CLF-C02 Final Review Sheet” in GitHub
- Revisit Shared Responsibility Model and global infrastructure
- Review Amazon Leadership Principles:
