# Daily Study Log — 2026-03-01  

## 📚 What I Worked On
- EC2 Instance Store vs Amazon EBS (block storage fundamentals)
- EBS Snapshots (point-in-time backups, incremental behavior)
- Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) for snapshot automation

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- Instance Store provides high-performance temporary storage with no data persistence.
- EBS volumes are persistent and independent of the underlying host.
- EBS snapshots are incremental after the first full backup and appear as full restore points.
- Deleting a snapshot does not break others; AWS preserves referenced blocks.
- DLM automates snapshot scheduling, retention, and cleanup for governance and compliance.

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- AWS Skill Builder (Module 6: Storage)
- Conceptual review of EBS snapshot lifecycle and DLM policies

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- Cross-AZ and cross-Region behavior of EBS volumes and snapshots
- EBS volume types and performance tradeoffs (gp3, io2, st1, sc1)

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Deep dive into EBS volume types and performance metrics (IOPS vs throughput)
- Review high availability strategies for EC2 + EBS across Availability Zones
- Practice architecture scenarios involving backups and disaster recovery
