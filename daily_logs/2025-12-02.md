# Daily Study Log — 2025-12-02 - First "official" log


## 📚 What I Worked On

- Updating and adding to the repo
- Automation and scripting
- Setting up a bash script to quickly create daily study logs from a template
- Learning about bash aliases and the `.bashrc` configuration file
- Understanding file paths in Git Bash on Windows (how `/c/Users/...` works)
- Exploring different automation options: VS Code snippets vs bash scripts vs batch files

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- `.bashrc` is a configuration file that runs every time you open Git Bash. By adding an alias to .bashrc, you create a shortcut command that maps a simple word (like newlog) to a full command or script path. When you type that alias from any directory, the computer looks up what the alias points to and executes it. This is different from adding something to PATH. an alias is a direct shortcut to one specific command, while PATH tells the computer which folders to search through when looking for any command.
- `.bashrc` is a configuration file that runs every time you open Git Bash - it's where you store shortcuts (aliases) and settings
- `source ~/.bashrc` reloads the settings without closing the terminal
- Bash scripts need `chmod +x` to become executable
- `${1:-default}` syntax in bash means "use first argument, or use default if nothing provided"
- `$(date +%Y-%m-%d)` generates today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- Aliases are shortcuts that let you type simple commands instead of long paths

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
```bash
pwd                    # Print working directory (shows where you are)
chmod +x script.sh     # Make a script executable
nano ~/.bashrc         # Edit bash configuration file
source ~/.bashrc       # Reload bash settings
alias newlog='path'    # Create command shortcut
cp source dest         # Copy files
chmod +x /c/Users/becon/Desktop/Brandos-learning-journey/scripts/newlog.sh # give execute permissions to created bash file
echo $PATH
```

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- automation and scripting


## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- see about the online web accessible portfolio you've been developing
- powercert network+ study session
- tryhack me lab work
- consider officially deploying repo to github
