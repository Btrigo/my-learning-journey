# Daily Study Log — 2026-01-05

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Reviewed API fundamentals, including request/response flow and common authentication patterns
- Refreshed knowledge on encryption, authentication, and authorization concepts
- Studied JWTs, OAuth 2.0, and SAML and how they are used to authenticate users and services
- Practiced reading and interpreting Wireshark logs to better understand traffic visibility and protocol behavior

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- APIs rely heavily on token-based authentication, with JWTs commonly used to carry identity and authorization claims
- Authentication and authorization are distinct: authentication proves identity, authorization defines access
- OAuth acts as a delegated authorization framework, not an authentication protocol by itself
- Wireshark can be used to validate assumptions about encryption, handshakes, and protocol behavior—even when payloads are encrypted

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- Wireshark (packet inspection, protocol identification)
- Conceptual review of HTTPS, TLS, and token-based authentication flows

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- When and why to choose OAuth vs SAML in real enterprise environments
- How JWTs are validated server-side (signing keys, rotation, expiration handling)

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Build or walk through a full authentication flow (client → API → token validation)
- Continue strengthening Wireshark analysis skills, focusing on TLS handshakes and encrypted sessions
- tryhackme labs and/or personal labs
