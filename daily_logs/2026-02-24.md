# Daily Study Log — 2026-02-24

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Reviewed TCP fundamentals (SYN / SYN-ACK handshake) and transport layer behavior
- Reinforced DNS resolution flow (recursive resolver → root → TLD → authoritative servers)
- Clarified frontend ↔ backend communication patterns in modern web applications
- Studied API architecture patterns: REST, GraphQL, Webhooks, and WebSockets
- Explored event-driven vs request-driven system design
- Continued AWS Cloud Practitioner review (cost management, security, compliance, support tiers)
- Uploaded `FCC_CLF_C02_06.md` study notes to GitHub repository

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- TCP uses a three-way handshake (SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK) to establish reliable connections
- DNS resolution is hierarchical and recursive — clients rely on recursive resolvers to query root, TLD, and authoritative name servers
- Frontend applications (e.g., React) communicate with backend APIs — not directly with databases
- REST is request-driven and stateless
- Webhooks are event-driven (server pushes data when an event occurs)
- WebSockets provide persistent, full-duplex communication channels for real-time applications
- Modern cloud architectures often combine REST (CRUD), Webhooks (external events), WebSockets (real-time UI), and queues (background processing)
- Understanding these patterns strengthens system design intuition beyond exam-level knowledge

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- Git repository update and file upload
- Markdown documentation formatting
- Architectural flow modeling (mentally mapping API interactions and DNS flow)

---

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- How WebSockets scale in distributed systems (connection brokers, pub/sub layers)
- GraphQL subscriptions vs raw WebSocket implementations
- AWS event-driven services (SNS vs SQS vs EventBridge)
- Real-world scaling considerations for high-concurrency applications

---

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Continue AWS CLF-C02 practice exams and study sessions.
- Revisit event-driven AWS services in more depth
- Begin mapping a small architecture diagram for a real-time application (practice system design thinking)
