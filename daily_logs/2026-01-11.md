# Daily Study Log — 2026-01-12

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Studied the client–server model using Minecraft as a practical, real-world example
- Analyzed differences between public server architectures and private server architectures
- Learned how private overlay networks (VPN-style overlays) enable secure, private connectivity without exposing services to the public internet
- Explored how operating systems implement overlay networking through virtual interfaces and routing
- Mapped home-lab networking concepts to enterprise and cloud architectures, including VPCs and security groups

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- The client–server model is independent of whether a server is public or private; only the network transport path changes
- Public servers expose services to the internet first and rely on firewalls and application controls afterward, increasing attack surface
- Private overlay networks create a virtual, encrypted LAN where only authenticated devices can communicate
- Overlay networking operates at the OS networking layer using virtual interfaces and routing rules, transparently to applications
- By implementing a “private network first, then application” model, entire classes of network-level attacks are eliminated
- This architecture directly mirrors how enterprises and cloud providers secure internal services using private networks and identity-based access

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- Conceptual review of OS networking components (network interfaces, routing tables, sockets)
- Studied overlay networking mechanisms (virtual interfaces, encrypted tunnels, peer authentication)
- Reviewed cloud networking constructs including Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), private IP ranges, and security group-style access controls

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- Detailed comparison between overlay networks, traditional VPNs, and Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)
- How private networking models change when clients are consoles or mobile devices
- Deeper inspection of routing tables and packet flow during encrypted overlay communication

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Review routing tables, network interfaces, and packet flow in greater technical detail
- Continue mapping home-lab networking concepts to enterprise and cloud security models
- Apply these principles to securing non-gaming services such as APIs, databases, and administrative interfaces
