# Daily Study Log — 2026-02-13  

## 📚 What I Worked On
- AWS Config walkthrough (rules, remediation actions, conformance packs)
- Deep dive into AWS CloudTrail (Event History vs Trails)
- CloudWatch core components:
  - Logs (Log Groups, Log Streams, Log Events)
  - Logs Insights
  - Metrics
- Trail creation process (S3 storage, KMS encryption, log validation, SNS, CloudWatch integration)
- Cost considerations when logging Management vs Data events
- AWS WorkDocs and AWS Directory Service overview

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- CloudTrail Event History provides 90 days of management event visibility by default.
- To retain logs beyond 90 days, you must create a Trail, which delivers logs to S3.
- Trails can be multi-region and (when configured properly) span AWS Organizations.
- Logging Data Events (e.g., S3 object-level activity) can become expensive quickly.
- CloudWatch Logs Insights allows interactive querying of logs without exporting to S3/Athena.
- A CloudWatch Metric is a time-ordered set of data points monitored over time.
- Many AWS services automatically publish logs or metrics to CloudWatch.
- AWS WorkDocs is similar in concept to Microsoft SharePoint (managed collaboration/document service).
- AWS Directory Service allows you to run Microsoft Active Directory as a managed AWS service.

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- Navigated CloudTrail Event History
- Viewed raw JSON event records
- Walked through Trail creation (S3 bucket configuration, SSE-KMS encryption)
- Explored CloudWatch Logs, Log Streams, and Log Insights query interface
- Reviewed predefined metrics under AWS namespaces (e.g., EC2)

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- AWS provides sample CloudWatch Logs Insights queries — I want to practice log analysis to extract meaningful insight.
- Best practices for organization-wide CloudTrail setup (management account vs member accounts).
- Cost optimization strategies for logging at scale.
- When to use CloudWatch Logs Insights vs Athena for log analysis.

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Begin ML & AI section (clear conceptual breakdown first)
- Understand difference between AI, ML, Deep Learning, and Generative AI
- Map AWS ML services to real-world use cases
- Continue strengthening logging + monitoring fundamentals
