# Daily Study Log — 2026-02-17

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Read the amazon leadership principals 
- Reviewed AWS Service Level Agreements (SLA, SLI, SLO concepts)
- Studied Region-Level vs Instance-Level SLAs (EC2, EBS, ECS, Fargate)
- Reviewed DynamoDB and RDS SLA uptime commitments
- Learned the difference between Service Health Dashboard and Personal Health Dashboard
- Reviewed AWS Trust & Safety (Abuse reporting process)

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- SLAs are formal commitments published on aws.amazon.com — not configured in the console.
- Region-Level SLAs (multi-AZ deployments) provide higher availability than Instance-Level SLAs.
- Personal Health Dashboard shows account-specific impact, while Service Health Dashboard shows global AWS status.
- AWS Support does NOT handle abuse reports — AWS Trust & Safety does.
- To report malicious activity originating from AWS resources, use abuse@amazonaws.com or the AWS Abuse Report form.

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- Navigated AWS SLA documentation via public AWS site
- Reviewed Service Health Dashboard (public)
- Reviewed Personal Health Dashboard (console)
- Explored AWS Abuse reporting page

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- Calculate allowed downtime for 99.99% and 99.95% SLAs
- Deep comparison: CloudWatch vs AWS Health vs Trusted Advisor
- Review compliance programs (SOC, ISO, HIPAA)

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Finish final hour of CLF-C02 video
- Take structured notes on any remaining services
