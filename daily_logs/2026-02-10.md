# Daily Study Log — 2026-02-10  

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Launched EC2 instances using **Launch Templates**
- Reviewed Elastic IP behavior and static public addressing
- Explored EC2 pricing models (On-Demand, Reserved Instances, Spot, Savings Plans)
- Studied Tenancy options (Shared vs Dedicated vs Dedicated Host)
- Built and tore down an Auto Scaling Group
- Reviewed identity concepts: Identity Providers (IdPs), Federation, SAML, OAuth 2.0, and SSO
- Compared AWS CloudTrail vs CloudWatch
- Continued studying Zero Trust architecture principles

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- **Elastic IPs** provide a static public IPv4 address that can be reassociated with another instance, allowing endpoint stability even if infrastructure changes.
- **Launch Templates** standardize EC2 configuration (AMI, instance type, security groups, etc.) and are foundational for scalable, repeatable deployments.
- **Tenancy** determines whether compute runs on shared hardware or dedicated physical hardware — typically relevant for compliance or licensing requirements.
- **Dedicated Instances and Dedicated Hosts** are used when regulatory, contractual, or licensing constraints require physical isolation.
- **Reserved Instances vs Convertible RIs** differ primarily in flexibility — Standard offers higher savings, Convertible offers exchange flexibility.
- **Spot Instances** provide significant cost savings for fault-tolerant and flexible workloads.
- **Savings Plans** reduce costs through usage commitments rather than reserving specific instance attributes.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** centralizes authentication, allowing access to multiple systems after a single login.
- In a **Zero Trust model**, identity becomes the primary security boundary rather than the network perimeter.
- **CloudTrail** records API activity for auditing; **CloudWatch** monitors metrics, logs, and operational health.

## 🛠 Tools & Services Practiced
- Amazon EC2
- Launch Templates
- Auto Scaling Groups
- Elastic IP allocation and association
- IAM fundamentals
- AWS Management Console navigation

## ❓ Topics to Reinforce
- Dedicated Instance vs Dedicated Host use cases in enterprise environments
- Practical identity federation flow (IdP → Assertion → Service Provider)
- Real-world tradeoffs between Savings Plans and Reserved Instances

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Revisit scaling policies (Target Tracking vs Step Scaling)
- Diagram identity federation and SSO flows from memory
- Continue strengthening understanding of AWS pricing models
- Practice explaining tenancy and pricing differences clearly and concisely
