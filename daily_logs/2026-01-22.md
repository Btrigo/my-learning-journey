# Daily Study Log — 2026-01-22

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Deployed online portfolio to brandontrigo.com using Hostinger
- Converted single-file HTML portfolio into professional multi-file structure (separate HTML, CSS, JS files)
- Replaced text-based header with custom logo image
- Adjusted CSS styling for header sizing and logo display
- Cleaned WordPress files from public_html and deployed static site
- Fixed HTML structure issues (missing closing tags in contact section)
- Reformatted "whoami" section with proper line breaks and spacing for better readability

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- Professional web development uses separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript rather than embedding everything in one file
- File structure matters: index.html must be in public_html root, with css/ and js/ folders properly organized
- CSS padding vs image sizing: adjusting header padding changes header height without affecting logo size
- How HTML tags work: <br> for line breaks, &nbsp; for spacing, proper nesting of <div> tags
- Web hosting basics: how to use Hostinger File Manager, move files, and deploy a static website
- Browser caching: need to hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to see changes after updating files

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- Hostinger File Manager: file upload, folder creation, moving files, deleting files
- HTML: <img> tags, <p> tags, <br> line breaks, proper div nesting
- CSS: adjusting padding, height properties, hover effects
- Browser DevTools: inspecting elements to troubleshoot styling issues
- File path references: relative paths for linking CSS, JS, and image files

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- Ensure you adjust the README.md section of your public GitHub repository
- Review the difference between NOC/SOC/Help Desk positioning vs offensive security/pentesting positioning in portfolio content
- Consider whether portfolio messaging aligns with target job roles
- Learn more about how DNS and web hosting work at a deeper technical level

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- **ADJUST YOUR WEBSITE SO THAT THE HEADER DISAPPEARS AS THE USER SCROLLS!!! - THIS CHANGE WILL ALLOW YOU THE FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE YOUR LOGO EVEN LARGER THAN IT IS!! 180PX PLUS!
- Continue to update GitHub repository -
- From top to bottom, go over portfolio code and inspect to understand what's happening at a deeper level
- Study HTML/CSS fundamentals to better understand the code structure
- Consider adjusting portfolio content to better target NOC/SOC roles if that's the career path
