# Daily Study Log — 2025-02-12

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Deep dive into full-stack web application networking and architecture
- Understanding how frontend (React) communicates with backend APIs
- Explored AWS services and frameworks for building full-stack applications
- Learned about "translation layers" between different parts of an application stack

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- **Networking flow for web apps**: User → Frontend (S3/CloudFront) → API Gateway → Backend (Lambda/EC2) → Database (DynamoDB/RDS) → S3 (storage)
- **Frontend-backend communication**: React makes HTTP requests (fetch/axios) to API endpoints, backend responds with JSON data
- **CORS configuration**: Required to allow frontend and backend on different domains to communicate
- **Authentication flow**: User signs in → receives JWT token → token sent in Authorization header for all subsequent requests
- **Translation layers**: 
  - AWS DynamoDB Document Client translates between JavaScript objects and DynamoDB's native format
  - ORMs translate between code objects and SQL database tables
  - API Gateway can transform request/response formats
- **File upload optimization**: Use presigned S3 URLs to upload directly to S3 (bypasses backend bottleneck)
- **AWS Amplify vs Manual setup**:
  - Amplify is "all-in-one" framework that abstracts AWS complexity (fast prototyping)
  - Manual setup teaches individual AWS services deeply (better for certification prep)
  - Best approach: Start with Amplify to see the whole picture, then rebuild manually to understand the internals

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- Conceptual understanding of:
  - `fetch()` and `axios` for HTTP requests in React
  - Express.js backend API endpoint creation
  - AWS SDK Document Client for DynamoDB
  - AWS Amplify CLI commands (`amplify init`, `amplify add auth/api/storage`, `amplify push`)
  - S3 presigned URL generation

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- Build and deploy a full stack React app on AWS
  - **AWS Amplify** - is your "all-in-one" framework (good for quick start)
  - **Manual setup** is better for learning purposes (better for AWS cert prep)
  - **Recommended path**: Phase 1 - Build with Amplify, Phase 2 - Rebuild manually
- Practice creating actual API endpoints with Express/Lambda
- Hands-on with API Gateway configuration and CORS setup
- Implement authentication flow with Cognito
- Build a simple file upload feature with presigned S3 URLs

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- **Decide on first full-stack project**: Simple playlist/video app or different use case?
- **Research AWS Amplify tutorials**: Find "Getting Started" guide or freeCodeCamp tutorial
- **Continue AWS Cloud Practitioner study**: Review compute, storage, and database services with new context
- Create comprehensive study notes markdown file from today's networking deep dive
