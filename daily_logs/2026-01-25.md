# Daily Study Log — 2026-01-25

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Certified cloud practitioner study and note taking 
- First 2 hours of FreeCodeCamp AWS CCP CLF-C02 course
- AWS account setup, IAM user creation, MFA configuration
- Billing alerts, budgets, and cost monitoring setup

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- CLF-C02 exam: 65 questions, 90 min, 700/1000 to pass, valid 3 years
- Root user vs IAM user - never use root for daily work
- AWS Free Tier: 12 months, specific limits per service
- MFA is mandatory for security - set up on root account
- ElastiCache default instance warning - check pricing before launching
- US-East-1 recommended for learning (most services, some only available there)
- Evolution: Dedicated → VPS → Shared → Cloud hosting
- Service models: IaaS (AWS) → PaaS (Beanstalk) → SaaS (Gmail)
- Deployment models: Public, Private, Hybrid, Multi-Cloud
- AWS is leader per Gartner Magic Quadrant

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- Created AWS account with IAM admin user
- Set account alias for easier login
- Configured MFA with authenticator app (virtual MFA)
- Created AWS Budget ($100 limit, 80% alert threshold)
- Set up CloudWatch billing alarm with SNS notifications
- Enabled free tier usage alerts

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- How does CloudFormation work in detail? (briefly mentioned in validators)
- What's the difference between anomaly detection vs static thresholds?
- When would I actually use Quantum computing (Braket)?
- Which services are Global vs Regional? (need comprehensive list)

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Continue video - next 2 hours (AWS Global Infrastructure section)
- adjust readme for github repo to reflect personal as well as professional growth
- secure your page
- Review and memorize the 4 exam domains and their weights
- Practice identifying the Four Core Services in real scenarios
