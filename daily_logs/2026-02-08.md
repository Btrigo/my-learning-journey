# Daily Study Log — 2026-02-07

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Light review of previously created AWS notes
- Passive reinforcement of AWS concepts through continued exposure (videos, prior discussions)
- Took a deliberate rest day due to work and Super Bowl commitments

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- Rest days are part of sustainable learning, not a setback
- Continued mental reinforcement of:
  - EC2 fundamentals (instances, storage, networking)
  - Security concepts (Security Groups vs NACLs)
  - AWS operational workflows discussed in prior sessions
- Recognized the importance of pacing to avoid burnout during a long-term cloud learning journey

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- None (intentional rest day)

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- Revisit EC2 storage lifecycle concepts (EBS persistence vs instance lifecycle)
- Deeper review of EC2 operational states (reboot vs stop vs terminate)

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Resume hands-on AWS labbing
- Consolidate and clean up study notes for GitHub
- Continue EC2 + networking deep dive with practical examples
