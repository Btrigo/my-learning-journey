# Daily Study Log — 2026-02-04

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Reviewed two previously created study note files (CLF-C02 notes, parts 1 & 2)
- Watched ~52 minutes of the FreeCodeCamp AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) course
- Actively took notes while watching the course video
- Reviewed AWS Management Console layout and navigation concepts

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- AWS services can be grouped and understood by category (compute, storage, networking, security, etc.)
- Reinforced understanding of AWS storage types (EBS, EFS, S3) and how they differ conceptually
- Developed a better mental model of how users interact with AWS via the Management Console
- Continued clarification of SDKs, CLI, and how they fit into real-world AWS usage (topic to revisit)
- Confirmed the importance of region awareness when working in the AWS Console

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced

- Followed along in AWS Console while watching course material

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- Revisit SDKs vs APIs vs CLI (conceptual reinforcement planned)
- When to choose SDKs vs IaC in real-world cloud engineering scenarios
- Deeper dive into AWS service categories and how they map to architectures

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Continue reading AWS service documentation
  - Getting started sections: 30–60 minutes
  - Core concepts sections: 2–4 hours
- Revisit SDK concepts with a fresh perspective
- Continue progressing through the CLF-C02 course content
