# Daily Study Log — 2026-02-27

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Completed AWS Skill Builder Module 5: Networking in the AWS Cloud
- Completed AWS Skill Builder Module 6: Hybrid Connectivity & Edge Services
- Reviewed and answered assessment questions covering:
  - VPC architecture
  - Subnet segmentation (public vs private)
  - Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, and Virtual Private Gateway
  - Route 53 vs Global Accelerator vs CloudFront
  - Site-to-Site VPN vs Client VPN vs Direct Connect
- Reinforced foundational networking concepts inside AWS infrastructure

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- A VPC is a logically isolated virtual network where AWS resources are launched.
- Subnet type (public vs private) is determined by its route table configuration.
- Internet Gateway enables public internet access; NAT Gateway enables outbound-only access from private subnets.
- Virtual Private Gateway is the AWS-side endpoint for Site-to-Site VPN connections.
- Route 53 provides DNS-based intelligent routing using health checks and routing policies.
- Global Accelerator improves performance using AWS’s global network and static Anycast IPs.
- Site-to-Site VPN is cost-effective for encrypted hybrid connectivity.
- Client VPN is best for scalable remote workforce access with advanced authentication.
- Direct Connect provides a dedicated physical connection for higher performance and consistency.

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- Conceptual review of routing behavior using:
  - `0.0.0.0/0` default route logic
- Reviewed VPC architecture flow (IGW → Route Tables → Subnets → NAT → VPN)
- Practiced service differentiation through scenario-based assessment questions

---

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- Deep dive comparison: Route 53 vs Global Accelerator in real-world architectures
- Visual mapping of hybrid cloud architecture (on-prem ↔ VPN ↔ VPC)
- Hands-on lab: Building a full public/private subnet architecture

---

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Create a clean VPC architecture diagram (public + private + NAT + IGW + VPN)
- Review Route 53 routing policies in more depth
- Complete 10+ practice scenario questions to solidify service differentiation
- Begin mapping networking concepts to real-world architecture examples
