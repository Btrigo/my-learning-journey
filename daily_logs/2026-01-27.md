# Daily Study Log — 2026-01-27

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Deployed EC2 instance (t2.micro, free tier eligible, us-east-1)
- Configured security groups with IP-restricted SSH access
- Connected to instance via SSH
- Set up AWS billing budget with cost alerts at 85%, 100% thresholds
- Terminated instance and verified resource cleanup

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- Security groups act as stateful virtual firewalls at the instance level
- Stopped vs terminated instances: stopped instances retain EBS volumes and incur storage costs (~$2.40/month for 30GB)
- Free tier coverage: credits applied automatically, visible as negative amounts in billing
- IAM roles required for automated budget actions (SNS notifications work without roles)
- Proper key pair management: store in secure location with restrictive permissions (chmod 400)
- Password management best practices using Dashlane for credential security

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- AWS Console: EC2 instance provisioning and lifecycle management
- Security group configuration: inbound rules with source IP restrictions
- SSH key pair generation and secure storage
- AWS Billing & Cost Management: budget creation, alert configuration
- Resource verification: EBS volume identification and cleanup

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- Security groups vs Network ACLs (NACLs): differences and use cases
- IAM role creation for AWS Budgets automated actions
- Best practices for managing multiple key pairs across environments
- CloudWatch integration with billing alerts

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Launch new EC2 instance with local SSH connection from workstation
- Configure Apache web server installation and hardening
- Test security controls: port opening/closing, firewall rules
- Create CloudWatch alarms for instance monitoring
- Document complete workflow with actual commands used
- Practice security groups vs NACLs implementation
