# Daily Study Log — 2026-02-06

## 📚 What I Worked On

- Reviewed AWS Cloud Practitioner notes from previous study sessions
- Reinforced cloud architecture fundamentals (VPCs, Regions, AZs, Global Infrastructure)
- Practiced configuring CloudWatch billing alerts with SNS email notifications
- Reviewed IaaS vs PaaS responsibility model with focus on runtime and operating system layers

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways

- Security Groups act as resource-level firewalls, while NACLs operate at the subnet level
- Runtime refers to the execution environment (Node.js, Python, JVM, etc.) that runs application code inside an OS
- Default VPCs are automatically created by AWS and serve as beginner-friendly networking environments
- SNS requires confirmed subscriptions before CloudWatch alarms can deliver notifications
- AWS architecture separates networking security (SG/NACL) from identity permissions (IAM Roles/Policies)

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced

- AWS Console navigation (CloudWatch, SNS, VPC, Billing Dashboard)
- SNS Topic and Subscription configuration
- CloudWatch Alarm setup and troubleshooting
- Reviewing documentation and architecture concepts from CLF-C02 notes

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review

- Deeper understanding of IAM Roles vs Policies vs Resource Permissions
- How runtime management changes between IaaS, PaaS, and Serverless architectures

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow

- Continue Cloud Practitioner course progression
- Review shared responsibility model and IAM fundamentals
- Reinforce networking concepts (subnets, routing, internet gateways)
