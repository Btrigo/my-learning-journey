# Daily Study Log — 2026-02-23

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Completed first Tutorials Dojo CLF-C02 practice tests
- Reviewed AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) in depth — perspectives, stakeholders, and use cases
- Studied AWS Well-Architected Framework — 6 pillars, general design principles, and pillar-specific principles

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- **AWS CAF** is a framework/whitepaper (not a service) used to assess cloud readiness BEFORE migration. The 6 perspectives are: Business, People, Governance, Platform, Security, Operations. Each has distinct stakeholders — e.g. CISO = Security, Architects/Engineers = Platform.
- **AWS CAF vs AWS Migration Hub**: CAF = planning/readiness phase. Migration Hub = tracking during active migration.
- **Well-Architected Framework has 6 pillars**: Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, Sustainability. The 6 general design principles (exam staple): Stop guessing capacity, test at production scale, automate experimentation, allow evolutionary architectures, drive with data, improve through game days.
- **"Perform operations as code"** is an Operational Excellence principle — not a general design principle and not Security.
- **NACLs vs Security Groups**: NACLs operate at the subnet level and are stateless (need explicit inbound + outbound rules). Security Groups operate at the instance level and are stateful (return traffic auto-allowed).
- **AWS Compute Optimizer** = rightsizing tool. Trigger words: "under-utilized", "over-provisioned", "rightsize". Auto Scaling does NOT rightsize — it scales quantity, not instance size.
- **EC2 pricing models**: On-Demand (default/flexible), Savings Plans (1 or 3yr commitment, most flexible discount), Reserved Instances (deeper discount, less flexible), Spot (cheapest, interruptible), Dedicated Hosts (compliance/licensing).
- **Multi-AZ = resilience**. Multiple subnets in the same AZ do NOT guarantee resilience. Multiple VPCs = network isolation, not availability.
- **Amazon Redshift ML** = train ML models using SQL inside a data warehouse (built on SageMaker). Trigger: "SQL + ML + data warehouse".
- **EC2 M1 Mac instances** = only option for building native iOS/macOS apps on AWS.
- **CLF-C02 domain weights**: Cloud Concepts 24%, Security & Compliance 30%, Cloud Technology & Services 34%, Billing & Pricing 12%.

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- Tutorials Dojo CLF-C02 Practice Mode 
- Reviewed AWS console for Redshift ML, EC2 Mac instances, and Well-Architected Tool

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- Question 12 was incorrect — need to review that service (not yet covered in log)
- Deep dive needed on IAM: roles, policies, users, groups, and least privilege in practice
- Review all AWS security services: Shield, WAF, GuardDuty, Macie, Inspector, Security Hub
- Billing domain needs more attention: AWS Organizations, Cost Explorer, Budgets, Trusted Advisor support plans
- Review migration strategies (6 R's: Rehost, Replatform, Repurchase, Refactor, Retire, Retain)

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Complete a second full Tutorials Dojo practice test (all domains, timed)
- Review all incorrect answers from today 
- Read Tutorials Dojo cheat sheets for: AWS CAF, Well-Architected Framework, VPC/NACLs/Security Groups
- Begin targeted review of Security & Compliance domain (30% of exam — highest priority)
