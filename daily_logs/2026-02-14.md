# Daily Study Log — 2026-02-14

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Intentionally took the day off for Valentine’s Day.
- No CLF-C02 study completed today.
- Mentally reviewed long-term path: CLF-C02 → SAA → Remote Cloud Role.

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- One planned day off does not break consistency.
- Discipline = returning immediately to the plan.
- Momentum is built by execution the next day, not by guilt.

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- None (planned recovery day)

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- Rewatch architecture diagram section (~3h 06m) and pause to fully understand service relationships.
- Clarify how EC2, S3, RDS, and IAM interact inside a real deployment.
- Review Auto Scaling Groups and horizontal scaling vs vertical scaling.

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow 
- Resume CLF-C02 course review immediately.
- Take structured notes in Markdown (clean + GitHub-ready).
- Do at least one hands-on walkthrough in AWS Console (compute or storage focused).
- No zero-day. Minimum 60–90 focused minutes.
