# Daily Study Log — 2026-01-28 → 01-29

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Launched EC2 instance (t3.micro, Amazon Linux 2023) with proper security configuration
- Configured security groups: SSH restricted to my IP, HTTP open to public (0.0.0.0/0)
- Successfully connected to instance via SSH using RSA key-based authentication
- Updated system packages and applied security patches (`sudo yum update -y`)
- Installed and configured Apache web server (httpd)
- Deployed custom HTML web page
- Implemented Apache security hardening (directory indexing, version hiding, server signature)
- Performed attack surface analysis and service enumeration
- Created comprehensive project documentation with README and screenshot guide
- Properly terminated resources and verified cleanup

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways

**Networking & Security:**
- Security groups act as stateful virtual firewalls at the instance level
- Distinction between exposing SSH (admin access, lock down tight) vs HTTP (public service, calculated risk)
- Understanding when exposing ports is a security risk vs. necessary functionality
- Public web servers require HTTP (80) open to 0.0.0.0/0 by design
- SSH from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) is dangerous; SSH from specific IP is secure

**RSA Key Pairs:**
- How asymmetric encryption works for SSH authentication
- Public key stored on server, private key stays on client
- Challenge-response authentication prevents private key from traveling over network
- Key permissions must be 400 (read-only for owner) for SSH to accept them
- Default usernames vary by AMI (ec2-user for Amazon Linux, ubuntu for Ubuntu)

**Apache Security Hardening:**
- Directory indexing (`Options -Indexes`) prevents file enumeration attacks
- `ServerTokens Prod` hides version details in HTTP headers (reduces reconnaissance)
- `ServerSignature Off` removes version info from error pages
- Attack surface reduction through minimal information disclosure
- Defense-in-depth: layering multiple security controls

**Cloud Concepts:**
- VPCs are free logical network boundaries (don't "run", just exist)
- Default VPC automatically created in each region
- Shared Responsibility Model: AWS secures infrastructure, I secure what I deploy
- Even servers without sensitive data are valuable targets (computing resources, network position)
- Stopped instances cost $0 but attached EBS volumes cost ~$0.08/GB-month

**AWS Resource Management:**
- Difference between terminated and stopped instances
- EBS volumes can persist after instance termination (orphaned volumes cost money)
- Security groups are reusable and cost nothing
- Key pairs stored in AWS are just metadata (free)
- Proper cleanup prevents unexpected charges

**Package Management:**
- Amazon Linux uses `yum` (RPM-based, Red Hat family)
- Ubuntu uses `apt` (Debian-based)
- Apache package called `httpd` on RHEL systems, `apache2` on Debian systems
- `systemctl` manages services (start, stop, enable, status)

**Text Editors:**
- Nano is beginner-friendly (Ctrl+X to exit, shows commands at bottom)
- Vim is powerful but has steep learning curve (`:wq` to save and quit)
- Both accomplish same task (editing config files)
- Chose nano for accessibility during learning phase

**Documentation:**
- Importance of documenting security controls with "why" not just "what"
- Professional README structure includes architecture, security analysis, cleanup procedures
- Screenshot sanitization critical (redact IPs, instance IDs, account numbers)
- Portfolio-ready documentation explains security thinking, not just commands

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced

**AWS CLI:**
```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances                    # List instances
aws ec2 terminate-instances                   # Terminate instance
aws ec2 describe-volumes                      # Check for orphaned volumes
aws ec2 delete-volume                         # Delete unused volumes
aws ec2 describe-security-groups              # View security group rules
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress      # Add firewall rules
aws ec2 describe-key-pairs                    # List SSH key pairs
```

**SSH:**
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/aws-keys/lab-01-key.pem ec2-user@<PUBLIC_IP>
chmod 400 key.pem                             # Set proper key permissions
```

**System Administration:**
```bash
sudo yum update -y                            # Update all packages
sudo yum install httpd -y                     # Install Apache
sudo systemctl start httpd                    # Start service
sudo systemctl enable httpd                   # Enable on boot
sudo systemctl status httpd                   # Check service status
sudo systemctl restart httpd                  # Restart service
```

**File Management:**
```bash
sudo chmod 644 file.html                      # Set file permissions
sudo chmod 755 directory                      # Set directory permissions
sudo rm -r directory                          # Remove directory recursively
sudo mkdir /path/to/dir                       # Create directory
```

**Apache Configuration:**
```bash
sudo nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf         # Edit Apache config
sudo bash -c 'cat > /var/www/html/index.html << EOF'  # Create file with heredoc
```

**Verification & Testing:**
```bash
curl http://localhost                         # Test web server locally
curl -I http://localhost                      # Check HTTP headers
sudo grep "pattern" /path/to/file            # Search config files
sudo systemctl list-unit-files --type=service --state=enabled  # List services
```

**Networking:**
```bash
curl ifconfig.me                              # Get public IP
```

**Tools Used:**
- AWS CLI for infrastructure management
- Nano for text editing
- curl for HTTP testing
- systemctl for service management
- grep for searching files
- AWS Console for visual verification
