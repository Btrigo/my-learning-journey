# Daily Study Log — 2026-02-07

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Continued the **AWS CLF-C02 video course** (another 1+ hour)
- Reviewed and reinforced **VPC fundamentals** (subnets, route tables, gateways)
- Deep dive into **EC2 concepts**:
  - Instance lifecycle
  - Instance families
  - Default vs Dedicated Instances vs Dedicated Hosts
- Hands-on walkthroughs of:
  - Security Groups
  - Network ACLs
  - Route table associations
- Explored **AWS Systems Manager (SSM)** as an alternative to SSH key pairs
- Introduced **CloudFront and CDNs**, including origins and behaviors
- Reviewed **EC2 User Data** and instance bootstrapping

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- **Security Groups** act as a firewall at the *instance* level  
  - **YOU CREATE ONLY ALLOW RULES**
  - All other traffic is implicitly denied
- **Network ACLs (NACLs)** act as a firewall at the *subnet* level  
  - Support explicit **ALLOW and DENY** rules  
  - Rules are evaluated in numerical order
- **Public vs Private Subnets** are determined by **route table associations**, not by name
- Internet access requires:
  - An **Internet Gateway**
  - A route (`0.0.0.0/0`) pointing to that gateway
- **Elastic IPs** provide a static public IPv4 address that can be reassigned
- **SSM Session Manager** can replace SSH key pairs:
  - No inbound ports required
  - Access controlled via IAM
  - No private keys stored locally
- You can attach an **IAM role** to an EC2 instance to enable SSM access
- **User Data scripts** run at instance launch and can automate configuration
- **CloudFront**:
  - Uses **origins** (e.g., S3, ALB)
  - Uses **behaviors** to control caching and routing
- Operational best practice:
  - Reboot instances to confirm configuration persistence
  - Terminate instances and clean up resources after labbing

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- `systemctl start httpd`
- `systemctl enable httpd`
- `chmod 400 <private-key>.pem`
- Editing EC2 **User Data** scripts (bash)
- AWS Management Console:
  - EC2
  - VPC
  - Security Groups
  - Network ACLs
  - CloudFront
  - Systems Manager (Session Manager)
- CIDR range visualization using **cidr.xyz**

---

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- Differences between **reboot, stop, and terminate** in EC2
- When to prefer **CloudFront vs ALB caching**
- Deeper dive into **SSM permissions and session logging**
- How instance metadata (IMDSv2) ties into security best practices

---

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Continue CloudFront + CDN architecture patterns
- Review EC2 persistence vs ephemeral behavior in detail
- Start light **Python + AWS (Boto3)** exploration
- Clean up and organize study notes in GitHub repo
