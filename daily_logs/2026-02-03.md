# Daily Study Log — 2026-02-03

## 📚 What I Worked On
- CLF-C02 practice, note taking, follow-along with freecodecamp
- AWS Cloud Practitioner course (3h:45m - 4h:10m): Cloud Architecture, AWS APIs, CLI, SDK, and developer tools
- Created comprehensive study notes on AWS Global Infrastructure, disaster recovery strategies, and programmatic access to AWS

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- AWS real-world architectural diagram helps a lot. Find as many as you can and create your own for learning purposes.
- Elastic Beanstalk (high availability) - will do everything that you'd have to do manually if you were to create an app using EC2
- **Cloud Architecture fundamentals**: High Availability ≠ just having multiple servers - need multi-AZ deployment + load balancer
- **Disaster Recovery hierarchy**: Backup/Restore (cheapest, hours) → Pilot Light (~10 min) → Warm Standby (minutes) → Active-Active (real-time, most expensive)
- **RPO vs RTO**: RPO = how much data loss you can tolerate; RTO = how much downtime you can tolerate
- **ARNs uniquely identify ALL AWS resources** across the entire platform - format: `arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource`
- **AWS CLI vs SDK**: CLI for terminal commands, SDK for writing code in programming languages (Python, Ruby, Node.js, etc.)
- **CloudShell** makes it super easy to use AWS CLI without local setup - credentials already loaded
- **Three ways to interact with AWS**: Management Console (clicking), CLI (terminal commands), SDK (programming)

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- AWS CLI basic commands: `aws s3 ls`, `aws s3 cp`, `aws ec2 describe-instances`
- AWS SDK (Ruby example) for listing S3 buckets programmatically
- CloudShell navigation and credential management
- Cloud9 IDE setup for AWS development
- Configured AWS CLI with `aws configure` (Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, region, output format)

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- API services - need deeper understanding of how AWS API actually works under the hood
- How to choose between different disaster recovery strategies based on business requirements
- When to use AWS SDK vs AWS CLI in real-world scenarios
- Multi-account strategies and cross-account IAM roles (mentioned but not fully covered)
- More hands-on practice with architectural diagrams

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Continue FreeCodeCamp course from 4h:10m onwards
- Practice creating at least one simple architectural diagram
- Try hands-on: launch EC2 instance across multiple AZs with load balancer
- Research real-world AWS architecture examples from companies like Netflix, Airbnb
