# Daily Study Log — 2026-02-04

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Reviewed freeCodeCamp CLF-C02 course (timestamps ~3:30:00 - 6:00:00)
- Re-watched last 30-40 minutes from previous session to solidify understanding
- Studied AWS CLI, CloudShell, ARNs, SDKs, and Infrastructure as Code concepts
- Explored Shared Responsibility Model across different service types
- Learned about AWS compute services (EC2, containers, Lambda)
- Covered edge and hybrid computing (Outposts, Wavelength, Local Zones, VMware Cloud)
- Introduction to High Performance Computing (HPC) and AWS ParallelCluster

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- ***AWS Labs GitHub*** - AWS hosts hands-on tutorials and sample code at https://github.com/aws-samples/, separate from main documentation
- Easy to think of **IaC (Infrastructure as Code) as a *blueprint* of your infrastructure**
    - CloudFormation allows you to write IaC as either JSON or YAML
    - **Stack** = actual infrastructure built from template (blueprint)
    - **Template** = the blueprint file defining resources
- **AWS CloudShell storage is NOT EFS** - it's AWS-managed persistent storage (1GB per region in $HOME)
- **CloudShell** = browser-based CLI, pre-authenticated, free, perfect for quick tasks
- **ARNs (Amazon Resource Names)** uniquely identify resources: `arn:aws:service:region:account-id:resource`
- **Shared Responsibility Model** - "Security **IN** the cloud" (customer) vs "Security **OF** the cloud" (AWS)
    - Simple rule: "Can you configure it?" → Your responsibility
    - Responsibility shifts with service type: IaaS (most) > PaaS > SaaS > FaaS (least)
- **Access Keys** = programmatic credentials (NEVER commit to code, max 2 per user)
- **AWS CLI v2** is current; v1 enters maintenance mode July 2026, end-of-support July 2027
- **Compute options strategy:** EC2 (most control) → ECS/EKS → Fargate → Lambda (least management)
- **Edge Computing** = push workloads close to users (Wavelength for 5G, Local Zones for cities)
- **Hybrid Computing** = workloads on-premise AND in AWS cloud
- **HPC** = supercomputer-level computing using AWS ParallelCluster for scientific workloads

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- Explored AWS CLI commands (S3 operations: `aws s3 ls`, `aws s3 cp`, `aws s3 mb`)
- Learned CloudShell navigation and persistent storage concepts
- Understood CloudFormation stack operations (`create-stack`, `delete-stack`)
- Reviewed CDK CLI commands (`cdk init`, `cdk deploy`, `cdk destroy`)
- Practiced finding AWS documentation and API references
- Understood AWS credentials configuration (`~/.aws/credentials`, `~/.aws/config`)

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- **AWS SDK and Cloud9** - Need more hands-on practice with Boto3 (Python SDK) and Cloud9 IDE environment
- **CDK (Cloud Development Kit)** - Deeper dive into CDK constructs and how to build reusable infrastructure components
- **CDK constructs library** - Explore https://constructs.dev for pre-built patterns
- How ParallelCluster actually works in practice (job submission, scheduling)
- Wavelength setup process (carrier gateways, networking configuration)
- Difference between ECS task definitions and services

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Continue with freeCodeCamp CLF-C02 course (pick up around 6:00:00 mark)
- Consider installing AWS CLI locally vs continuing with CloudShell
- Practice writing simple CloudFormation templates
- Review compute services decision tree (when to use EC2 vs containers vs Lambda)
- Revisit Shared Responsibility Model examples for exam prep
- Start connecting Python learning to AWS (explore Boto3 basics)
