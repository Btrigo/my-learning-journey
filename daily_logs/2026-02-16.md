# Daily Study Log — 2026-02-16

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Continued AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) deep dive
- Studied the AWS Well-Architected Framework in detail
- Reviewed all six pillars and their Design Principles
- Analyzed the structure of a Well-Architected Pillar (Design Principles → Definition → Best Practices → Resources)
- Studied the AWS Well-Architected Tool and how it is used for workload assessment

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides structured guidance across 6 pillars: Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, and Sustainability.
- Each pillar contains Design Principles, Definitions, Best Practices, and supporting Resources.
- Operational Excellence emphasizes treating infrastructure as code and making small, reversible changes.
- Security design principles revolve around least privilege, traceability, defense in depth, and protecting data in transit and at rest.
- Reliability focuses heavily on automation, horizontal scaling, recovery testing, and eliminating single points of failure.
- Performance Efficiency encourages serverless architectures, experimentation, and global deployments.
- Cost Optimization centers on consumption-based models, financial visibility, and avoiding undifferentiated heavy lifting.
- The AWS Well-Architected Tool is an auditing tool that evaluates workloads against the framework and generates improvement reports.
- CloudWatch is primarily used for monitoring metrics and alarms, while CloudTrail is focused on auditing API activity and changes.

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- AWS Console navigation
- Reviewed AWS Well-Architected Tool interface
- Conceptual comparison of CloudWatch vs CloudTrail use cases

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- How to conduct a full Well-Architected review step-by-step in the AWS Console
- What a real-world Well-Architected report looks like in an enterprise setting
- How pillars interconnect during architecture tradeoff decisions

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Perform a structured, step-by-step walkthrough of the AWS Well-Architected Tool
- Simulate a mock workload review and answer assessment questions
- Read the full Amazon Leadership Principles page: https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles
- Continue reinforcing pillar definitions for CLF-C02 exam readiness
