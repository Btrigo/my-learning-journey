# Daily Study Log — 2026-02-21

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Completed TryHackMe DNS in Detail room — covered DNS record types, the full DNS resolution process, and practical DNS queries from the terminal
- Started and progressed through TryHackMe HTTP in Detail room — covered URL structure, HTTP requests/responses, HTTP methods, status codes, headers, cookies, and making requests
- Deep dived into how DNS recursive resolvers, root servers, TLD servers, and authoritative nameservers work together using real terminal output
- Explored how HTTP ties into cloud infrastructure — CloudFront, load balancers, API Gateway, WAF
- Had a breakthrough understanding of what an API call actually is and how it differs from a regular HTTP request

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- The full DNS resolution chain: recursive resolver → root servers → TLD servers → authoritative nameserver. The recursive resolver does the legwork and caches results for the TTL duration
- My ISP's recursive DNS servers were confirmed via `resolvectl status`
- CNAME records map one domain name to another, not to an IP — cannot be used on root/apex domains, AWS Route 53 Alias records solve this limitation
- MX records have a priority value — lower number means higher priority, tried first for mail delivery
- HTTP is stateless — cookies exist specifically to work around this limitation by passing session data back and forth in headers
- 401 vs 403 distinction — 401 means not authenticated, 403 means authenticated but not authorized. Critical distinction in AWS IAM troubleshooting
- UTF-8 is a character encoding — maps human readable characters to numbers which are then represented in binary at the hardware level
- An API call IS an HTTP request — the difference is the response is JSON/XML for a program to process rather than HTML for a browser to render
- Content-Encoding methods: gzip, Brotli, deflate — compression reduces data transfer size, relevant to CloudFront cost optimization
- HTTP methods mapped to actions: GET=read, POST=create, PUT=update, DELETE=delete

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- `dig google.com +trace` — full DNS traversal showing every hop from root to authoritative
- `dig google.com MX`, `dig google.com NS` — specific record type lookups
- `resolvectl status` — confirmed ISP recursive DNS servers per network interface
- `nslookup` — basic DNS lookups
- Firefox Developer Tools Network tab — observed live HTTP requests, methods, status codes, and response data
- TryHackMe HTTP emulator — manually crafted GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests and observed raw request/response headers

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- How SSH key exchange, signature, and encryption work together during a full SSH session under the hood
- How APIs handle authentication in production — tokens, OAuth, API keys vs simple username/password POST
- play with burp suite again.. how burp Suite can be used to intercept and manipulate HTTP requests
- Revisit APIs tomorrow to confirm understanding has fully clicked

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Start with API refresher to confirm understanding clicked
- Upload notes from last few hours of CLF-C02 FreeCodeCamp course
- Practice tests, practice tests, and more practice tests for CLF-C02 — pass that thing ASAP
