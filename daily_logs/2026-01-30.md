# Daily Study Log — 2026-01-30

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Set up an AWS CloudWatch alarm
- Worked through ~1 hour of the freeCodeCamp AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) course
- Followed along directly in the AWS Console while watching the course content

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- CloudWatch is significantly more powerful and flexible than AWS Budgets, especially for monitoring metrics and triggering actions
- `us-east-1` was Amazon’s **first AWS Region**, where core services like **SQS, S3, and later EC2** were initially launched  
  - New AWS services almost always appear in `us-east-1` first
- Each AWS Region typically has **3 Availability Zones** and does not exceed **6 AZs**
- Availability Zones contain one or more data centers and are designed to provide **low-latency connectivity (<10 ms)** between AZs
- When launching an EC2 instance, selecting a **subnet** is effectively choosing the **Availability Zone**
  - EC2 → Network settings → Subnet (read carefully what is selected)
- Only a small number of AWS services are **global** (for example: S3 and CloudFront)
- **CloudFront** is AWS’s Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- `amazonaws.cn` is the China-specific AWS domain  
  - AWS’s limited presence in China is due to **regulatory and compliance requirements**

## 🛠 Tools / Concepts Practiced
- Network ACLs (NACLs) vs Security Groups  
  - Subnet-level vs instance-level network controls

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- Direct Connect
- CloudFront (deeper understanding and real-world use cases)

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- When time allows, add visuals/screenshots to write-ups  
  - Prioritize learning and passing the exam first; visuals are for portfolio and employers
- Continue working through the CLF-C02 course and take notes while following along in the AWS Console
- Reminder: download and install Docker Desktop for Ubuntu at some point
