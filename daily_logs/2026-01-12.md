# Daily Study Log — 2026-01-12

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Completed TryHackMe Windows PowerShell room
- Installed LocalWP and began building personal portfolio website with WordPress
- Reviewed PowerShell fundamentals and object-oriented command structure

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- PowerShell uses object-oriented approach vs text-based commands (huge advantage over cmd.exe)
- Cmdlets follow consistent Verb-Noun naming convention (e.g., Get-Content, Set-Location)
- PowerShell objects have properties and methods that can be manipulated through pipelines
- Aliases exist for traditional commands (dir → Get-ChildItem, cd → Set-Location)
- PowerShell is cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) - can use on my Ubuntu setup

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- `Get-Command` - Discover available cmdlets (with -Verb, -Noun, -Name filters)
- `Get-Help <cmdlet>` - Documentation (with -Examples, -Detailed, -Full, -Online flags)
- `Get-Alias` - View command aliases
- `Find-Module` / `Install-Module` - Extend PowerShell functionality
- LocalWP - WordPress local development environment

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- How to write practical PowerShell scripts for automation tasks
- Using PowerShell Core on Ubuntu Linux for cross-platform automation
- AWS PowerShell modules - how they integrate with cloud automation goals
- Best practices for portfolio content - what projects/documentation to showcase

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Continue TryHackMe path or move to next room
- Draft portfolio content structure (certs, projects, GitHub links)
- Consider writing a simple PowerShell script to practice cmdlet usage
- Review OSI model and network troubleshooting methodology
