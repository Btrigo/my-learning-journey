# Daily Study Log — 2026-02-18

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Continued **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)** study (Part 3A + Part 3B).
- Reviewed and consolidated prior course notes while cross-referencing AWS documentation.
- Focused on **cost optimization models** and **storage/database service selection**.

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- **Cost & Capacity**:  
  - **Spot** = biggest savings but interruptible (good for fault-tolerant/batch).  
  - **Reserved Instances / Savings Plans** = commit for 1–3 years to reduce cost for steady workloads.  
  - **Auto Scaling + Load Balancing** = match capacity to demand and improve availability.
- **Storage selection** clarity:
  - **EBS (block)** = single-instance attached “disk” (boot volumes, DB storage).
  - **EFS (file/NFS)** = shared filesystem for multiple instances.
  - **S3 (object)** = API-based object storage; massive scale; ideal for static assets, backups, archives.
  - **S3 classes** are mainly about balancing **cost vs retrieval speed vs AZ redundancy** (Standard vs IA vs One Zone-IA vs Glacier tiers).
- **Database selection** clarity:
  - **RDS/Aurora** = relational OLTP workloads.
  - **DynamoDB** = serverless NoSQL (key-value/document) at massive scale + low latency.
  - **Redshift** = OLAP/data warehouse for analytics and aggregation.
  - Specialty DBs exist for special shapes of data: **Neptune (graph)**, **Timestream (time-series)**, **QLDB (ledger)**.
- Reality check from today: getting “lost” in docs usually means I’m learning the *why*, not just memorizing terms — but I need a tighter plan tomorrow to finish strong.

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- AWS Console exploration:
  - **Cost Management / Savings Plans**
  - **DynamoDB table creation + basic query/scan concepts**
  - **RDS instance creation (Dev/Test configuration awareness)**
  - **Redshift overview + query editor exposure (high-level)**

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- Digital signatures: how **hashing + asymmetric crypto** combine to provide **integrity + authenticity + non-repudiation**.
- When exam questions imply **encryption** vs **hashing** vs **MAC/HMAC** vs **digital signature**.

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Finish the remaining course content starting with:
  - **Digital signatures & signing** (hash → sign → verify flow).
  - Wrap remaining topics and do a quick end-to-end review pass.
- Take a **timed practice exam** to gauge readiness and identify weak areas.
- Based on results:
  - Drill weak domains with targeted review + a second practice set.
