# Daily Study Log — 2026-02-20

## 📚 What I Worked On
- Cloned my learning journey repo onto my desktop PC using SSH
- Generated an Ed25519 SSH keypair and uploaded the public key to GitHub
- Configured SSH config file and tested authentication to GitHub
- Set up `newlog` alias in `.bashrc` to run the bash script from anywhere
- Ran CLF-C02 practice tests via YouTube — worked through Digital Cloud Training's Practice Questions Walkthrough and started Tech Cert Academy's Domain Cloud Concepts exam questions video

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- Ed25519 is a digital signature algorithm, not a cipher — SSH uses all three categories under the hood: signature algorithm, key exchange, and cipher
- One SSH key per machine is best practice for easier revocation if compromised
- The `-C` flag in `ssh-keygen` is just a human-readable label baked into the public key
- Amazon MemoryDB is the Redis-compatible in-memory data store for sub-millisecond latency use cases like caching, session stores, and real-time analytics — not DynamoDB, RDS, or Redshift

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "comment" -f ~/.ssh/keyname`
- `git clone`, `git diff`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`
- `chmod`, `ls -l`, `nano ~/.bashrc`, `source ~/.bashrc`

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- Review how SSH key exchange and encryption work together under the hood during a session
- Review distinctions between similar AWS database services — MemoryDB vs ElastiCache, DynamoDB vs RDS
- Look into how Git handles file permission tracking across different machines

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Continue CLF-C02 practice tests — finish Tech Cert Academy Domain Cloud Concepts video
- Begin reviewing database service distinctions
