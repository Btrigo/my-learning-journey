# Daily Study Log — 2026-01-19

## 📚 What I Worked On
- TryHackMe Linux Shell Scripting module (Linux Shells room)
- Created and executed my first bash scripts (first_script.sh, loop_script.sh)
- Troubleshot script execution issues (shebang syntax error)
- Learned about different Linux shells (Bash, Fish, Zsh) and their features
- Set up SSH connection to TryHackMe AttackBox via personal VPN

## 🧠 What I Learned / Key Takeaways
- **Shebang importance**: The `#!/bin/bash` line must be exact - missing the leading `/` causes "bad interpreter" errors
- **Script execution methods**: `./script.sh` relies on shebang and execute permissions, while `bash script.sh` explicitly calls the interpreter
- **Why `./` is needed**: The shell only searches PATH directories by default; `./` tells it to look in the current directory
- **Shell comparison**: Bash is widely compatible for scripting, Fish is beginner-friendly with auto-correction, Zsh offers advanced customization
- **Core scripting concepts**: Variables store reusable values, loops automate repetitive tasks, conditionals control program flow based on conditions
- **Best practice**: Always use `chmod +x` to make scripts executable properly

## 🛠 Commands / Tools Practiced
- `chmod +x script.sh` - Grant execute permissions to scripts
- `./script.sh` - Execute script in current directory
- `bash script.sh` - Run script explicitly with bash interpreter
- `echo $SHELL` - Check current shell
- `cat /etc/shells` - List available shells on system
- `nano` - Text editor for creating/editing scripts
- `ssh root@<ip>` - SSH into TryHackMe AttackBox
- `sudo openvpn config.ovpn` - Connect to TryHackMe VPN

## ❓ Questions I Still Have / Topics To Review
- Should I finish CS50 before diving deeper into DevOps/Cloud, or learn them in parallel?
- What's the best balance between foundational CS knowledge and hands-on cloud certifications for breaking into DevOps?
- How much Python scripting vs. Bash scripting should I prioritize for cloud automation?

## 🎯 Plan for Tomorrow
- Work on portfolio
- Continue TryHackMe Linux scripting module (loops and conditional statements practice)
- Practice writing custom bash scripts to automate simple tasks
- Research DevOps learning path and create a roadmap for AWS/Azure certifications
